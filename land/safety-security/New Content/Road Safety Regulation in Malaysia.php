			<p>Road safety regulations in Malaysia include speed limit, seatbelt wearing, helmet wearing, and a maximum BAC level.  For example, speed limits in urban areas range from 50km/h to 80km/h and rural areas between 70km/h and 110km/h.  Seatbelt wearing is compulsory for all private vehicle occupants.  At the same time, helmet wearing in motorcycles has been compulsory since 1973.  Currently, the Malaysian Government is in the process of amending the Road Transport Act 1987 for the BAC level in Malaysia to meet the international standard of 0.05g.dl as recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The use of Child Restraint System (CRS) in private vehicles in Malaysia was implemented in January 2020 and must comply with the UN Regulation standard â€“ R44 and R129.</p>
