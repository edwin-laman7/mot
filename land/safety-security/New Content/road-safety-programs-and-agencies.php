			<h2>Malaysia Institute of Road Safety Research (MIROS)</h2>
			<p>The Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research (MIROS) was established in 2007 as an agency under the Ministry of Transport Malaysia to serve as a central repository of knowledge and information on road safety. The findings derived from research and evidence- based intervention programs provide the basis for the formulation of new strategies, legislations, policies, and enforcement measures, governing road safety at the national level. Principally engaged in research, MIROS collaborates closely with local and international government agencies and private bodies to further the cause of road safety.</p>
			<p>In 2014, the ASEAN Transport Minister had appointed MIROS as the ASEAN Road Safety Centre. The aims of this centre are to promote and provide knowledge on road safety issues among ASEAN Member States which includes road traffic laws and regulations, data management, standards development, and road safety awareness and education.</p>
			<p>One of the programs under MIROS is the New Car Assessment Program which is a collaborative program with Global NCAP based on the Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2011. The fundings for the first phase of this program was provided by Global NCAP.</p>

				For advocacy programs, they are focusing on the No Week Without Advocacy program (TMTA), where road advocacy programs are conducted in each and every state on a weekly basis focusing on different target groups. Education of road safety is part of the national curriculum where it is taught as part of the national language subject, Bahasa Melayu at the primary and lower secondary level. Besides, this division has also embarked on an intervention initiative at the district and local levels, called the My Safe Road Program. The program focuses on districts with a high number of fatalities and blackspots across the country. The pilot project carried out in Batu Pahat, Johor in 2016-2017 showed positive reduction of fatalities due to road traffic accidents of over 20% or 42 lives (207 deaths in 2016 reduced to 164 in 2017). This project has been expanded nationwide. This division also actively runs media and social media campaigns at the national and state level to engage the public throughout the year.
