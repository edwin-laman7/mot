			Child Restraint System (CRS) is a seat that is designed for child safety in vehicles. The seat helps to protect children during road crashes from severe injuries when install in the vehicle correctly. In Malaysia, the CRS regulation has been gazetted by the Road Transport Department (JPJ) under the Road Transport Act 1978 - Motor Vehicles (Safety Seat-belts) (Amendment) Rules 2019. On 1st January 2020, the law was implemented for private vehicles. The rules stated that CRS used in Malaysia must comply to UNR standard (R44 or R129) and children must weigh less than 36 kg, or with a height less than 136 cm, or aged below 12 years old. As announced by the Minister of Transport, the current enforcement is by advocacy approach for those who are caught not using CRS for their child. Based on observation research by MIROS, there is an increment in the percentage of CRS awareness among drivers, which is from 44% in 2019 to 50% in early 2020.
