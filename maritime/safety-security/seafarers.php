					<h2>Seafarers</h2>
					<p>Seafarers consisting of deck and engineering crew are responsible for overall ship operation and maintenance. Seafarers need to possess technical expertise and extensive knowledge with regards to ship operation. Therefore, every seafarer must have a high level of competency to ensure safe ship operation at all times. In this context, relevant certificates such as Certificate of Competency and Certificate of Recognition are issued by the Marine Department of Malaysia to seafarers as recognition of their competency level thus allowing them to serve on board ships.</p>
